# Biography

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science & Physics in Rider Universityâ€˜s [Department of Computer Science & Physics](https://www.rider.edu/academics/colleges-schools/college-liberal-arts-sciences/departments/computer-science-physics).

I specialize in using large surveys, like SDSS, Gaia, and WISE to study the formation and evolution of the Galaxy.  I'm excited about the future of surveys with WFIRST and the [Vera Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/).

Primarily I use cool, red stars to study two regimes in the Milky Way.   When measuring Galactic structure near the Sun, I use cool, red dwarfs, the most common type of star.  To study the distant Milky Way halo, I use the much more rare, but much brighter, red giants.  Please see my research page for recent papers and [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22Bochanski%2C%20J.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) for all of my published work.
