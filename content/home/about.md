# Biography

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science & Physics and Chair of Rider Universityâ€˜s Department of Computer Science & Physics.

I specialize in using large surveys, like SDSS, 2MASS and WISE to study the formation and evolution of the Galaxy.

Primarily I use cool, red stars to study two regimes in the Milky Way.   When measuring Galactic structure near the Sun, I use cool, red dwarfs, the most common type of star.  To study the distant Milky Way halo, I use the much more rare, but much brighter, red giants.  Please see my research page for more information and other projects.
